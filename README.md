# Libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that youâ€™ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

## Notes

+ Most of the the files and function names are namespaced with an ft in front. It stands for Fourty Two
+ The project instructions require that we put all the source files in the root directory but for the sake of this Github repo, I separate them into sub folders.
+ I update this list almost every month with new personal functions. If you don't know what a function does, refer to the Wiki, where I document all my personal functions.

## How does it work?

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, cd into the project, copy all the files from the sub folders to the root directory and finally, call 'make'.

## Example usage

+ [get_next_line](https://github.com/azazelija/get_next_line)
+ [Fillit](https://github.com/azazelija/Fillit)
+ [ft_printf](https://github.com/azazelija/ft_printf)
+ [push_swap](https://github.com/azazelija/push_swap)
